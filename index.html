      <mark>Avatar</mark> is a 2009 epic science fiction film written and
      directed by James Cameron. It features an ensemble cast including Sam
      Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney
      Weaver.[5] Distributed by 20th Century Fox,[b] it is the first installment
      in the Avatar film series. The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when
      humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the
      Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable unobtanium,[c] a
      room-temperature superconductor mineral. The expansion of the mining
      colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a
      humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a
      genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely
      located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora called
      an "Avatar".[9]
